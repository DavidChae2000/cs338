1. Passive information gathering

I investigated carleton.edu. The IP address is 137.22.94.116. The domain's registration expires on July 31 2024. carleton.edu has contacts in the form of network managers and system admins as well as Chris Dlugosz and Daniel James Stephans.

2. Host Detection

192.168.52.2, 192.168.52.128 - kali instance's network interface IP, 192.168.52.129 - metaspoitable were active.
For each possible IP address, nmap broadcasted "who has [IP address]? Tell 192.168.52.128." If that IP address is active, it would recieve the reply "[IP address] is at ...".

137.22.4.5, 137.22.4.17, 137.22.4.131 were active.
Kali would send a TCP handshake initialization to each possible IP address and the active ones would complete the TCP handshake.

3. Port Scanning

PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
22/tcp   open  ssh
23/tcp   open  telnet
25/tcp   open  smtp
53/tcp   open  domain
80/tcp   open  http
111/tcp  open  rpcbind
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
512/tcp  open  exec
513/tcp  open  login
514/tcp  open  shell
1099/tcp open  rmiregistry
1524/tcp open  ingreslock
2049/tcp open  nfs
2121/tcp open  ccproxy-ftp
3306/tcp open  mysql
5432/tcp open  postgresql
5900/tcp open  vnc
6000/tcp open  X11
6667/tcp open  irc
8009/tcp open  ajp13
8180/tcp open  unknown

The RSA SSH host key is 56:56:24:0f:21:1d:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3.

rmiregistry on port 1099 is used by RMI servers to bind remote objects to names for lookup purposes.
